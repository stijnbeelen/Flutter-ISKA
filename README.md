## Useful dev tips

Alt + Enter on a Container Widget -> wrap with new widget
When text is altered, Hot reload doesn't always work
Function overloading is NOT supported in Dart -> optional named/unnamed parameters
String interpolation: "$name", "${player.name}", "${exists ? "it exists" = "it does not exist"}"

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.io/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our 
[online documentation](https://flutter.io/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Presentation Remarks
Setup even zoeken: flutter doctor niet altijd even duidelijk. (zie afbeeldingen)

W: Layout in de componenten zelf schrijven is wennen als je Android gewoon bent.

More info about the BLoC architectural pattern later.
In the meantime, [Reactive Programming - Streams - BLoC](https://www.didierboelens.com/2018/08/reactive-programming---streams---bloc/) by [Didier Boelens](https://www.didierboelens.com/) is a great resource.
